Abstract
Concept drift—changes in the underlying data distribution over time—poses a significant 
challenge to machine learning systems deployed in dynamic environments. While numerous drift detection methods have been developed for structured data such as tabular and 
time-series streams, concept drift in image data remains an underexplored area due to 
the unstructured and high-dimensional nature of visual information. This survey presents 
the first comprehensive review of concept drift detection methods tailored for image data 
streams. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches based on 
key properties such as image feature handling, detection strategy, detection level, concept 
drift cause, and evaluation considerations. Through the lens of this taxonomy, we analyze 
14 representative concept drift detection methods designed for image data, highlighting 
current approaches to the field, their strengths and limitations. Based on this analysis, we 
outline promising future research directions to advance the field of concept drift detection 
in image-based systems.

1 Introduction
1.1 Motivation
In dynamic environments, changes are inevitable, and the systems we build often need to 
account for these shifts. From abnormal weather patterns affecting climate models to market 
trends affecting stock trading, many real-world processes are subject to changes that occur 
over time. These changes can happen unpredictably, and they pose a significant challenge to 
systems designed to make accurate predictions based on historical data. When the underlying characteristics of data evolve, models that previously worked well begin to fall short of 
accurate predictions—a phenomenon known as concept drift.

Concept drift detection in image data stream: a survey on current…
Concept drift, first introduced by Schlimmer and Granger (1986), refers to changes in the 
conditional distribution P (y|x), where the relationship between input features x and target 
labels y evolves over time in non-stationary environments. In the other hand, data drift (also 
known as covariate shift) denotes changes in the input features distribution P (x) (Ackerman et al. 2020). For example, a change in lighting conditions in an image stream may 
constitute data drift, whereas the emergence of new object classes or evolving definitions 
of existing classes represents concept drift. Data drift may or may not result in concept 
drift; however, it is often considered an early indicator of concept drift and is commonly 
addressed in concept drift as virtual drift. A more detailed discussion of this distinction is 
provided in Sect. 2.
Concept drift is a central problem in dynamic learning scenarios, where data distributions 
evolve over time. Beyond this setting, several related research areas have emerged, including domain adaptation, out-of-distribution detection, novelty detection, open set recogni -
tion, and generalized category discovery. While not all of these explicitly assume temporal 
or streaming data, they share conceptual similarities with concept drift and are often dis -
cussed together. However, their boundaries are sometimes blurred in the literature, leading 
to inconsistent usage and overlapping terminology. To provide clarity, we attempt to make 
a comparison between these concepts in Table 1. A key distinction among these fields lies 
in their primary focus. Concept drift detection and data drift detection address the temporal

dimension, as they monitor how distributions evolve over time (Gama et al. 2014; Ackerman et al. 2020) in dynamic or streaming environments. In contrast, out-of-distribution 
detection, open set recognition, novelty detection, and generalized category discovery are 
not inherently temporal problems; instead, they operate by comparing data encountered 
at test time with what was observed during training, with the aim of identifying whether 
samples belong to unknown or unseen distributions or classes (Y ang et al. 2024; Pimentel 
et al. 2014; Geng et al. 2021; V aze et al. 2022). However, approaches in these fields can still 
be applied to concept drift or data drift problems: for example, novelty detection techniques 
can help identify emerging classes in real drift scenarios, while out-of-distribution detection 
methods may support early warning signals of distributional changes. Domain adaptation, 
on the other hand, differs from both groups: rather than detecting shifts, its goal is to adapt 
models trained on a source domain to perform effectively on a target domain with different statistical properties (Farahani et al. 2021). This distinction highlights why concept 
drift requires specialized methods, since its challenges are inherently tied to evolving data 
streams and the necessity for continual adaptation.
In the context of image data, concept drift poses critical challenges that directly impact 
the reliability of computer vision systems. For instance, an image classification model 
deployed in autonomous vehicles may face evolving conditions such as new weather pat -
terns, varying lighting, or unfamiliar road signs, all of which alter the relationship between 
visual features and semantic labels. Similarly, in medical imaging, the manifestation of 
diseases may change over time or new imaging technologies may be introduced, leading to 
shifts in how features correspond to diagnostic categories. In both scenarios, the conditional 
distribution P (y|x) evolves, rendering the model’s previously learned parameters suboptimal. These examples illustrate why concept drift is particularly important in image-based 
applications: visual data are inherently dynamic, and without mechanisms to detect and 
adapt to drift, models risk significant degradation in performance and reliability in realworld deployments.
Concept drift detection has attracted growing attention over the past decades. In its early 
stages, most existing methods relied heavily on ground-truth labels to detect changes in 
data distribution (Gama et al. 2004; Gama and Castillo 2006; Baena-Garcıa et al. 2006). 
More recently, research interest has shifted toward unsupervised approaches that aim to 
detect drift without requiring labeled data. However, the majority of these techniques are 
designed for structured (tabular) or time-series data and often perform poorly when applied 
directly to image data. A common strategy to address this gap involves extracting feature 
embeddings from images and applying concept drift detection methods to the resulting representations. The advent of deep learning in the 2010 s has revolutionized image analysis, particularly in feature extraction, with models such as Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs) (Krizhevsky et al. 2012) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al. 2021) 
demonstrating remarkable capabilities in learning rich image representations. Leveraging 
deep learning models is therefore critical for improving feature extraction quality, which 
in turn enhances the accuracy and robustness of drift detection in image data. This sur -
vey focuses not only on traditional approaches but also emphasizes deep learning-based 
image representations, recognizing their crucial role in effectively handling image data and 
improving concept drift detection accuracy.
The existing literature surveys on concept drift are extensive but vary in focus. We summarize existing surveys in Table 2 to point out their strengths and limitations, as we high -

light the importance of our survey paper. Gama and Gonalves’ surveys (Gama et al. 2014; 
Gonçalves et al. 2014) offer foundational knowledge about concept drift and detection/
adaptation strategies, yet they predate the era of deep learning dominance and lack focus on 
unstructured data like images. Lu’s review (2019) expands on detection methods and realworld applications but still underrepresents deep learning approaches, especially in han -
dling concept drift in image data. Xiang’s paper (2023) focuses on concept drift adaptation 
in deep learning models, offering insights into methods like incremental and transfer learning. However, it does not address the challenges specific to image data or representation 
learning. Recently, Lukats’ survey (Lukats et al. 2024) gives a comprehensive benchmark 
on fully unsupervised concept drift detectors, which is the trend in concept drift detection, 
yet most of the mentioned papers are designed for tabular data only.
In contrast to previous survey papers, our work seeks to make a distinctive contribution 
to the research literature through the following goals:
 ● Propose a dedicated taxonomy that captures the key characteristics and properties of 
concept drift detection methods specifically for image data.
 ● Provide an overview of traditional concept drift detection methods and a critical anal -
ysis of image-based concept drift detection methods to highlight their strengths and 
limitations, thereby identifying significant gaps and underexplored areas in the current 
literature.
 ● Outline promising future research directions aimed at addressing these gaps and ad -
vancing the field of concept drift detection for image data.

1.2 Survey structure
The rest of this survey is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the fundamental back -
ground on concept drift. In Sect. 3, we review traditional concept drift detection approaches 
and summarize the current challenges in traditional methods. Section 4 proposes a taxon -
omy of key properties for concept drift detection methods in image data. Section 5 presents 
our discussion of the surveyed methods, their strengths and weaknesses through the lens of 
the proposed taxonomy. Section 6 discusses open challenges and future research directions. 
An overview of the survey structure is illustrated in Fig. 1.
2 Background
2.1 Definition of concept drift
The term concept drift was first introduced by Schlimmer and Granger (1986) in his work on 
incremental learning algorithms, where he addressed the challenge of adapting to changes 
in the underlying data distribution over time. Since this publication, more researchers have 
expanded their point of view on the concept, most of them refer to the fact that the underlying data stream distribution changes over time (Widmer and Kubat 1996; Iwashita and Papa 
2019; Desale and Shinde 2022). Concept drift has also been referred to by different authors 
under alternative terms, such as dataset shift (Quiñonero-Candela et al. 2009) or concept 
shift (Widmer and Kubat 1996).
In this section, we will define concept drift in line with the most commonly accepted 
interpretation found across the majority of the literature (Gama et al. 2014; Lu et al. 2019; 
Xiang et al. 2023; Greco et al. 2024; Kuppa and Le-Khac 2022). “Concept" refers to the 
underlying relationship between the input features X and the target outputs Y . This “concept" can be expressed as the joint probability distribution P , which shows how likely 
certain values of X and Y occur together. According to the chain rule of probability, we can 
represent this joint probability distribution mathematically as follows:
 P (X, Y)= P (X )· P (Y|X ) (1)

Concept drift occurs when the joint probability distribution changes over time. In other 
words, there is a point in time t1 that differs from the initial time t0 where the distribution 
P has shifted. This shift can be formally expressed as:
 ∃X :Pt0 (X, Y) ̸=Pt1 (X, Y) (2)
As in Eq. 1, we can understand that the causes for the change in distribution P could either 
come from the input distribution P(X ), or the conditional output distribution P(Y |X ), or 
sometimes both. Hence, we can distinguish different causes of concept drift: 
1. Virtual drift (Delany et al. 2005) refers to changes in the distribution of input features 
without altering the conditional distribution of outputs, i.e., Pt0 (X) ̸=Pt1 (X) while 
Pt0 (Y|X )= Pt1 (Y|X ). Unlike data drift, which broadly denotes shifts in the input 
distribution, virtual drift is defined more strictly by its lack of impact on the decision 
boundary. Nonetheless, virtual drift is often regarded as an early indicator of real con -
cept drift, and in practice, both types frequently occur simultaneously.
2. Real concept drift refers to the changes in the conditional distribution of outputs, i.e. 
Pt0 (Y|X ) ̸= Pt1 (Y|X ). These changes can happen with or without virtual drift and 
can result in a change in the decision boundary. To fully understand the causes of real 
concept drift, we recall the Bayesian Decision Theory (Duda et al. 2001): 
 
P(Y|X )= P(X|Y )· P(Y)
P(X) (3)
 According to the equation, we can see that P(Y |X ) can be affected by two components: P (Y ), the prior distribution of outputs, and P(X |Y ), the likelihood of input features given a particular output. These components, when studied individually, are often 
treated as separate machine learning problems, highlighting the complexity behind 
real concept drift. Changes in P (Y ) together with P(X ) could imply the problem of 
novelty classes, while shifts in P(X |Y ) could suggest an in-class evolution of input 
features, meaning that some associated patterns/characteristics between X and Y have 
been changed. Real concept drift has also been referred to as concept shift (Salganicoff 
1997) and conditional change (Gao et al. 2007).
In practice, most concept drifts are mixtures of virtual drift and real concept drift. This 
means that changes in the input distribution P(X ) and the conditional distribution P(Y |X ) 
often occur simultaneously, creating a more complex drift scenario. Figure 2 provides an 
intuitive illustration of the different causes of concept drift in a two-dimensional vector 
space, demonstrating how each type of drift can influence the decision boundary. This visualization helps clarify the distinct impacts of virtual drift (which does not affect the decision boundary) and real concept drift (which can cause significant changes to the decision 
boundary).

2.2 Types of concept drift
Concept drift can appear in different forms, depending on how the underlying data distribution changes over time. According to Gama et al. (2014), there are four most common types 
(illustrated as in Fig. 3): Abrupt drift occurs when there is a sudden shift from one concept to 
another; Incremental drift happens more gradually, as the data slowly transitions from one 
concept to another; Gradual drift refers to a situation where the old and new concepts coexist for a time before one eventually dominates; Recurring drift occurs when a previously 
seen concept reappears after some time.

Concept drift detection in image data stream: a survey on current…
To illustrate these different types, let’s consider an example of an autonomous vehicle 
system tasked with detecting pedestrians and objects on the road:
 ● Abrupt Drift: The vehicle might be deployed in a new environment, such as moving 
from a city with clear, well-marked roads and traffic signs to a rural area with dirt paths 
and unclear traffic signs. This sudden change in the environment can cause an abrupt 
shift in the types of objects the model detects, making its previous training inadequate.
 ● Incremental Drift: Over time, the lighting conditions change gradually throughout the 
day, from bright sunlight to dusk and eventually nighttime. As the lighting changes in -
crementally, the model’s ability to detect pedestrians and objects slowly shifts, requiring 
gradual adaptation to different lighting conditions.
 ● Gradual Drift: Imagine that the vehicle operates in an environment where road condi -
tions and weather fluctuate. For a few hours, it might be raining, affecting the visual 
clarity of the sensors. The model might need to oscillate between handling dry roads 
and wet roads before eventually stabilizing when the rain stops. The gradual transition 
between these conditions leads to a drift in the model’s performance.
 ● Recurring Drift: In this case, the vehicle may experience different driving conditions 
depending on the season. For example, in winter, it has to deal with snow-covered roads, 
while in summer, it encounters clear roads. This seasonal recurrence requires the model 
to adapt to the recurring changes in the environment, where the same road looks different depending on the time of year.
Most adaptive learning techniques, whether explicitly designed or implicitly structured, 
tend to focus on handling specific types of concept drift, with a heavy emphasis on sudden, 
nonrecurring changes. These abrupt drifts, where the data distribution shifts dramatically 
and immediately, are relatively easier to detect and address with traditional methods such 
as the Drift Detection Method (DDM) (Agrahari and Singh 2022). However, in real-world 
applications, concept drift is rarely isolated to a single type; it is often a mixture of various 
drift types such as gradual, incremental, or recurring drift, which adds complexity to detection and adaptation.
2.3 Related concepts
2.3.1 Self-supervised learning in concept drift
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in representation 
learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing. Unlike super -
vised learning, which requires large amounts of labeled data, SSL leverages pretext tasks 
or self-generated supervision (e.g., predicting missing parts of an input, contrastive similarity learning) to learn meaningful feature representations directly from unlabeled data. 
Methods such as SimCLR (Chen et al. 2020), MoCo (He et al. 2020), BYOL (Grill et al. 
2020), SwA V (Caron et al. 2020), and masked autoencoders (MAE) (He et al. 2022) have 
demonstrated that SSL can produce embeddings that are both semantically rich and robust 
to noise in the input features.
These properties are particularly relevant in the context of concept drift. First, SSL rep -
resentations reduce sensitivity to input variations, thereby lowering the risk of false alarms 
1 3

Q.-T. Tran et al.
due to virtual drift while still highlighting real drift that affects the conditional distribution 
P (y|x). Second, since labels are often scarce or delayed in streaming environments, SSL 
offers a natural way to build or maintain robust feature spaces for drift detection without 
continuous reliance on labeled data. Finally, SSL has shown promise in related areas such 
as novelty detection and open-world recognition (Tack et al. 2020; Cao et al. 2022; V aze 
et al. 2022), where the ability to separate known from unknown classes directly supports 
the detection of real drift scenarios like the emergence of novel classes. Taken together, SSL 
provides both practical tools and conceptual alignment with the challenges of concept drift, 
making it an important direction for future research in non-stationary learning.
2.3.2 Concept drift interpretability and adaptation
Beyond the task of identifying whether drift has occurred, an important dimension 
of research is drift interpretability, which seeks to understand, explain, and localize the 
changes driving the drift. In this sense, drift detection can be viewed as the first step of 
interpretability: methods such as DDM (Gama et al. 2004), EDDM (Baena-Garcıa et al. 
2006), and ADWIN (Bifet and Gavalda 2007) not only signal the presence of drift but also 
provide indirect information about its nature, for example whether it is sudden or gradual. 
More advanced approaches go further by attributing drift to particular features, instances, 
or subspaces of the data. For instance, CDLEEDS (Ikonomovska et al. 2010) use tree-based 
models to highlight which parts of the input space are most affected, while statistical and 
distributional tests (Gretton et al. 2012) or feature-responsibility analysis (Rabanser et al. 
2019) aim to interpret which variables are responsible for observed changes. Such interpretability is crucial for distinguishing between virtual and real concept drift, and for informing 
how adaptation should proceed.
Adaptation represents the next step after drift detection and interpretation, focusing on 
how models should evolve once a change has been identified. In details, adaptation refers 
to updating or reconfiguring models so that they can maintain predictive accuracy under 
non-stationary conditions. A wide range of strategies have been developed to achieve this. 
Classical approaches include instance selection or weighting (Gama et al. 2014), sliding 
windows, and ensemble-based methods such as DWM (Kolter and Maloof 2007), Learn++.
NSE (Elwell and Polikar 2011), and Adaptive Random Forests (Gomes et al. 2017). Online 
learners like Hoeffding Trees (Domingos and Hulten 2000; Bifet and Gavaldà 2009) incrementally update their structure as new data arrive, ensuring responsiveness to evolving 
distributions. More recently, meta-learning and transfer learning techniques (Moradi et al. 
2024; Y u et al. 2022; McKay et al. 2020) have been introduced to accelerate adaptation, 
particularly in scenarios where concepts recur or related drifts appear across domains.
Together, drift interpretability and adaptation form an integrated pipeline for continuous 
learning: drift detection delivers the initial signal, interpretability reveals what has changed 
and why, and adaptation guides how the model should evolve in response. Incorporating all 
three layers ensures that systems are not only resilient to non-stationarity but also transparent and trustworthy in how they react to evolving data.

3 Traditional concept drift detection methods
This section provides an overview of general concept drift detection methods, including 
popular and classic approaches widely recognized in the literature. While these methods 
may not be specifically designed for or tested with image data, they offer foundational principles and techniques for addressing concept drift across various domains. Besides, this 
section introduces how drift detection methods are typically classified in the literature. This 
classification serves as a framework for understanding the diverse methodologies used to 
tackle concept drift, helping to contextualize the more specialized approaches discussed 
later in this survey.
In the literature, many survey papers have addressed concept drift detection, but different papers categorize concept drift detectors into different groups. Several surveys classify 
concept drift detection methods based on whether they operate in a supervised or unsuper -
vised setting (Hinder et al. 2024; Khamassi et al. 2018). The supervised methods rely on 
ground-truth labels, while unsupervised methods operate when labeled data is not available 
or limited. Semi-supervised methods can also work in an unsupervised setting since they 
only use labeled data in the training phase. In this survey, we consider semi-supervised 
methods as unsupervised methods.
Another common categorization divides concept drift detection methods into performance/error rate-based, distribution-based, and multiple hypothesis-based categories (Lu 
et al. 2019; Bayram et al. 2022). These categories are not specifically tied to whether the 
methods are supervised or unsupervised. However, when reviewing the methods within 
each category, it becomes evident that supervised approaches often focus on monitoring 
statistical measures or error rates. In contrast, unsupervised methods frequently utilize distribution-based techniques and hypothesis tests.
3.1 Supervised methods
Supervised methods in concept drift detection are utilized in scenarios where labeled data 
is available or can be obtained incrementally. These methods typically monitor the perfor -
mance of a learning model, such as error rate or statistical measures like accuracy, preci -
sion, recall, etc. to identify significant deviations that indicate a drift in the underlying data 
distribution. By leveraging labels, supervised drift detection approaches can provide direct 
and interpretable feedback on the impact of drift, making them highly effective for detecting 
abrupt or gradual shifts in data.
The classic Drift Detection Method (DDM) paper (Gama et al. 2004), proposed by Joao 
Gama in 2004, suggests monitoring the error rate of learning algorithms and detecting drift 
based on statistical differences in this error rate. It calculates a warning level and a drift 
level using a confidence interval approach and lets a new model learn when the drift level 
is reached. DDM’s simplicity and effectiveness in detecting abrupt drifts laid the foundation for several later methods, each addressing specific limitations of the original technique. 
One key limitation of DDM is its sensitivity to long-term gradual changes, where drifts 
occur slowly over time, making it less responsive to such scenarios. To address this, the 
paper Early Drift Detection Method (EDDM) (Baena-Garcıa et al. 2006) extends DDM by 
considering the distance between two errors rather than just the error rate itself. Learning 
with Local Drift Detection (LLDD) (Gama and Castillo 2006) extends DDM by focusing 
1 3

Q.-T. Tran et al.
on detecting drifts in local regions of the instance space rather than monitoring the entire 
model globally. Further developments like the Hoeffding Drift Detection Method (HDDM) 
(Frias-Blanco et al. 2014) and the Reactive Drift Detection Method (RDDM) (Barros et al. 
2017) were also built on the foundations laid by DDM. RDDM was designed to overcome 
the performance degradation of DDM in long stable concepts by periodically resetting its 
error calculation, making it more efficient for detecting drifts in extended, stable periods. 
HDDM, on the other hand, introduced the use of Hoeffding’s inequality to detect significant 
changes in performance statistics, which allowed it to work in scenarios without assump -
tions about the data distribution. Also inspired by Hoeffding’s inequality, Fast Hoeffding 
Drift Detection Method (FHDDM) (Pesaranghader and Viktor 2016) implements a sliding 
window to track the maximum and most recent probabilities of correct predictions, calcu -
lates the difference between these probabilities, and uses Hoeffding’s inequality to set a 
threshold for this difference. FHDDM shows a balance between accurate drift detection and 
reduced computational complexity.
The ADWIN (Adaptive Windowing) algorithm, proposed by Bifet and Gavalda (2007), 
represents a significant advance in concept drift detection by automatically adjusting the 
window size based on the rate of change in the data stream. Unlike fixed-window techniques, ADWIN continuously monitors the statistical properties of the data within its window, dynamically shrinking the window when a change is detected and expanding it when 
the data remains stable. ADWIN’s extension, ADWIN2 (proposed in the same paper), further improves time and memory efficiency by utilizing data stream algorithmics, allowing 
it to scale for large, real-time data streams with logarithmic memory and update time. This 
work laid the groundwork for subsequent research in adaptive windowing methods and has 
been widely applied in many real-world applications.
Other worth-mentioning methods in the field of concept drift detection include the 
Entropy-based Concept Shift Detection (ECSD) (V orburger and Bernstein 2006), the 
Dynamic Extreme Learning Machine (DELM) (Xu and Wang 2017) and Statistical Test of 
Equal Proportions Drift Detection (STEPD) (Cabral and Barros 2018). ECSD leverages an 
entropy-based measure to detect concept shifts by comparing two sliding windows of data. 
Meanwhile, DELM introduces monitoring the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier’s performance over time and raises an alert when the threshold is reached. STEPD detects 
concept drift by statistically comparing recent classifier accuracy with historical accuracy, 
signaling drift if the recent accuracy significantly decreases beyond a set threshold.
3.2 Unsupervised methods
Unsupervised concept drift detection methods play a crucial role in environments where 
labeled data is scarce or unavailable. These methods focus on identifying changes in the 
underlying data distribution when ground-truth labels are not available or limited. Unlike 
supervised approaches, which rely on tracking evaluation metrics, unsupervised methods 
monitor statistical properties of the data stream itself such as distributional changes to flag 
potential drifts. This makes them particularly useful in real-world scenarios where obtaining 
labeled data in real-time is costly and sometimes impractical.
Statistical tests are widely used in unsupervised concept drift detection due to their ability to identify changes in the underlying data distribution without relying on labeled data. 
Most of the works in the literature applied statistical tests to at least three different types of

information, as discussed by Žliobaite (2010), including: (1) raw data, (2) classifier outputs, 
and (3) estimated class labels. Sobolewski and Woźniak (2013) conducted an empirical 
study comparing statistical tests for detecting virtual concept drift, specifically applying the 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy two-sample t-test (Gretton et al. 2012), and a few other tests to evaluate their effectiveness in different drift scenarios. Their approach involved testing each data feature individually to determine whether 
each sample came from the same population as a reference dataset. They concluded that 
the KS test and two-sample t-test performed best, with high specificity and sensitivity in 
detecting drift in both real and synthetic datasets. These findings demonstrated the efficacy 
of traditional statistical tests in concept drift detection, which laid a foundation for future 
work to refine and optimize these methods further. Later works have attempted to further 
improve the two-sample t-test by using binary classifiers (Lopez-Paz and Oquab 2017) or 
deep learning kernel (Liu et al. 2020), enabling more powerful drift detection in complex, 
high-dimensional datasets. dos Reis et al. (2016) proposed the Incremental KolmogorovSmirnov (IKS) algorithm, which enhances the traditional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test by 
enabling incremental updates, reducing computational costs and enabling real-time drift 
detection in streaming data. Some other worth-mentioning tests include the Least Squares 
Density Difference (LSDD) test (Bu et al. 2018) and the Mean Embedding (ME) test and the 
Smooth Characteristic Function (SCF) test (Jitkrittum et al. 2016).
Another common approach in unsupervised drift detection involves training a classifier 
to differentiate between the distributions of past and current data. Hido et al. (2008) first 
proposed the approach in their paper “Unsupervised change analysis using supervised learning”, framing detecting change as a classification task. This approach deploys a classifier to 
discriminate between old and new distributions, using feature importance to highlight the 
primary drivers of drift. This supervised-insight approach for an unsupervised problem is 
versatile, offering explanatory insights alongside detection. Gozuacik further advanced this 
direction in two later works. In the first, he proposed a discriminative classifier approach 
(D3) (Gözüaçık et al. 2019) which monitors changes in the data distribution using a sliding 
window, detecting drift based on how well new samples align with previous feature distri -
butions. In a later study, he proposed the one-class classifier (OCDD) (Gözüaçık and Can 
2020) which focuses on outlier detection by identifying significant shifts in the data through 
unsupervised learning, making it ideal for scenarios with limited label access.
Other approaches focus on Model Uncertainty and Clustering. Baier et al. (2022) introduce Uncertainty Drift Detection (UDD), which detects drift by leveraging uncertainty estimates from neural network predictions, eliminating the need for labeled data. Using Monte 
Carlo dropout for Bayesian approximation, UDD identifies drift by monitoring changes 
in model uncertainty, thus minimizing unnecessary retraining on false alarms. Meanwhile, 
Chiu and Minku (2020) proposed clustering in the model space to manage an ensemble of 
models that are adapted to different concepts, enabling the detection and handling of both 
recurrent and novel drifts. The method maintains a memory of past models, where a clustering algorithm groups models based on prediction similarity, facilitating the retrieval of past 
knowledge when recurring drifts occur. Upon detecting drift, the framework creates a highly 
diverse ensemble from distinct clusters of past models, optimizing adaptation to drifts.
Recently, some novel approaches have been explored to detect concept drift more effectively. Cerqueira et al. (2023) present STUDD, a student-teacher model that identifies drift 
by tracking performance divergences between the student and teacher models over time. In 
1 3

Q.-T. Tran et al.
this approach, the student aims to replicate the teacher’s predictions, with drift flagged when 
discrepancies emerge, effectively using mimicking loss as a substitute for labeled feedback. 
Meanwhile, Gulcan and Can (2022) introduce the Label Dependency Drift Detector (LD3), 
tailored for multi-label data streams. This algorithm leverages label dependencies and ranking methods to detect drift by tracking shifts in label relationships, offering robustness in 
multi-label environments where traditional detection methods may fall short.
In another domain, graph-based representations have gained increasing attention as they 
naturally model entities and their complex interdependencies. Building on this foundation, 
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Ponzi and Napoli 2025) and Graph Signal Processing 
(GSP) (da Rosa et al. 2022) have emerged as powerful paradigms within deep learning, 
enabling effective interpretation and knowledge extraction from graph-structured data. 
Within the context of concept drift detection, several works have explored unsupervised 
graph-based approaches. For instance, Seeliger et al. (2017) proposed a method that derives 
process graphs from event logs and monitors structural graph metrics over time; by apply -
ing statistical tests to these metrics, their approach can detect changes in process behavior 
without requiring labels. Similarly, Paudel and Eberle (2020) introduced the Discrimina -
tive Subgraph-based Drift Detector (DSDD), which identifies representative subgraphs in 
a graph stream and tracks the entropy of their distribution within a sliding window. Drift 
is then detected using direct density-ratio estimation to capture significant changes in subgraph distributions. Both methods highlight how graph-based modeling, even in the absence 
of supervision, can provide powerful tools for identifying distributional shifts in evolving 
data streams.
3.3 Discussion
Despite advancements in both supervised and unsupervised approaches, several key chal -
lenges persist in the literature:
 ● Unsupervised Methods The importance of unsupervised methods lies in their ability to 
address the missing labels problem. They offer a viable alternative for scenarios where 
labeled data is unavailable or difficult to obtain. However, in literature, supervised 
methods are still dominant in number (Lu et al. 2019), and designing robust unsuper -
vised methods that can detect drift while maintaining low false positive rates remains 
a challenge.
 ● Concept Drift Understanding All drift detection methods are designed to detect “When” 
the drift happens, but very few methods have the ability to answer “How” and “Where”.
 ● Real-Time Detection Fast and robust detection is essential for systems operating in dy -
namic environments. Achieving real-time performance without compromising accuracy 
remains a significant challenge, especially as data volumes grow.
 ● Scalability Handling large datasets efficiently and generalizing across multiple domains 
is critical for practical adoption. Existing methods often fail to scale to big datasets or 
adapt to domain-specific nuances, limiting their utility in real-world applications.
 ● Drift Adaptation Speed The speed at which a model responds to drift is crucial for minimizing performance degradation. Many methods suffer from delayed adaptation, which 
can be detrimental in time-sensitive applications like autonomous driving or real-time 
surveillance.

 ● Evaluation Metrics Evaluating drift detection remains inconsistent across the literature. 
Metrics for detecting drift are not standardized, making it difficult to compare methods. Developing comprehensive and domain-agnostic evaluation frameworks is an open 
problem.
To address these challenges, more integrated and domain-specific approaches are needed. 
Combining robust unsupervised drift detection with deep learning-based feature extraction 
shows promise for unstructured data like images. Additionally, developing scalable, realtime methods and standardizing evaluation metrics will be critical to advancing the field. By 
addressing these gaps, future research can enhance the applicability of concept drift detec -
tion methods across a wider range of domains and data types.
4 Concept drift detection in image data: a taxonomy of key properties
In this section, we will introduce our interpretation of taxonomy for concept drift detection 
in image data streams. Based on a search strategy, we have chosen from the literature rel -
evant methods and summarize these methods together to propose a taxonomy of different 
characteristics/properties that are relevant when designing a concept drift detection method 
for image data.
4.1 Databases and search strategy
The literature search was conducted using a comprehensive selection of academic databases 
and digital libraries to ensure broad and relevant coverage of the topic. The sources include:

Advanced search features and Boolean operators were employed to effectively refine the 
search results across selected academic databases. The primary search keywords and their 
relevant synonyms are summarized in Table 3. These keywords were used in various combinations to ensure comprehensive coverage of the literature related to concept drift in image 
data.
To ensure relevance and quality of the selected works, we applied a three-stage filtering 
process based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in Table 4. An initial search 
yielded a total of 4,470 papers published between 2018 and 2025 that mentioned concept 
drift detection (meeting Criterion 1). Applying Criterion 2, which filters out studies that 
focus on non-image data types (e.g., tabular or textual data), reduced the pool to 271 papers. 
We then manually screened the title and abstract of each article to apply Exclusion Criterion 
3, which removed studies that did not address either core concept drift detection techniques 
or image data processing. This final step resulted in a curated set of 11 papers selected for 
in-depth review and analysis.
Given the limited availability of dedicated concept drift detection methods for image 
data in the current literature, we broaden our scope to include approaches that address various causes of concept drift, such as virtual drift and real concept drift (as discussed in 
Section 2). To this end, we draw from related fields in computer vision, including NovTable 3 Search keywords

elty Detection, Open Set Recognition and Generalized Category Discovery. Although these 
fields originate from different research setups, they share a common focus on handling distributional changes driven by the emergence of novel classes, an aspect closely aligned with 
the underlying causes of concept drift. We include three representative papers (Tack et al. 
2020; Cao et al. 2022; V aze et al. 2022) to highlight their primary focus and incorporate their 
approaches into our final taxonomy, as they offer valuable strategies that can be effectively 
applied to concept drift detection.
4.2 Taxonomy for concept drift detection in image data
Numerous studies have attempted to classify or provide a taxonomy for concept drift detection methods. Agrahari and Singh (2022) categorize detectors based on various criteria, 
while Lu et al. (2019) organize them according to the test statistics they employ. Additionally, Gemaque et al. (2020) introduce a taxonomy specifically for unsupervised approaches. 
However, these taxonomies are primarily designed for common concept drift detectors and 
do not account for the unique challenges posed by image data. Our proposed taxonomy does 
not aim to classify existing methods, but rather to outline and structure the key aspects and 
characteristics involved in designing concept drift detection methods for image data. In this 
section, we present our interpretation of the common properties and components that shape 
such methods. The proposed taxonomy is illustrated in Fig. 4.
4.2.1 Image features handling
Unlike other data types, images are unstructured and essentially just matrices of pixel values 
(e.g., RGB triplets). These numbers don’t mean anything directly in terms of semantics, like 
shapes, objects, or scenes. Hence, to detect concept drift in image data, we need methods for 
handling these features. Image features handling often include the below categories:
 ● Feature Extraction Feature extraction aims to transform raw pixel-level information 
into structured, informative representations that capture essential patterns such as edges, 
textures, shapes, objects or semantic contexts.

Q.-T. Tran et al.
 ● Feature Selection Feature selection focuses on identifying the most relevant features 
while discarding redundant or noisy ones. Feature selection often comes after feature 
extraction when dealing with image data.
 ● Dimension Reduction Instead of selecting important features, dimension reduction re -
fines the feature space by compressing it into a lower-dimensional manifold, preserving 
as much critical information as possible. This step not only reduces computational and 
memory requirements but also stabilizes statistical methods that are sensitive to highdimensional noise.
4.2.2 Detection strategy
Building on the definitions introduced in Section 3, concept drift detection methods can be 
broadly divided into supervised and unsupervised approaches.
4.2.3 Detection level
Traditional concept drift detection methods have predominantly focused on distributionlevel analysis, particularly within data stream mining. However, recent research trends propose finer-grained, instance-level detection, especially for complex and high-dimensional 
data such as images.
 ● Distribution-Level At the distribution level, methods aim to detect drifts between the 
overall data distributions across time. This can involve comparing statistical properties 
of batches or windows of data. Distribution-level detection is efficient for detecting 
global shifts and has better runtime efficiency.
 ● Instance-Level Instance-level detection focuses on identifying drift as individual sam -
ples. Methods operating at this level can detect subtle or localized drifts, such as the appearance of novel classes or in-class evolution. Instance-level approaches are important 
to pinpoint which instances directly cause the concept drift.
4.2.4 Concept drift cause
As outlined in Sect. 2, concept drift arises mainly from virtual drift (changes in the input 
distribution) and real concept drift (changes in the conditional distribution). Real concept drift can further be distinguished into in-class evolution and the emergence of novel 
classes.
4.2.5 Evaluation
 ● Evaluation Metrics The choice of evaluation metrics often depends on the primary fo -
cus of the drift detection method. For methods that emphasize accurate drift detection, 
evaluation typically involves drift-specific metrics such as detection delay, false alarm 
rate (false positives), and missed detection rate (false negatives). For methods where 
classification performance is also considered, standard machine learning metrics such 
as overall accuracy and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve

(AUROC) are often reported.
 ● Computational Complexity Computational complexity assesses the runtime efficiency 
of drift detection algorithms. For real-time applications, especially in high-dimensional 
image data streams, it is crucial that detection methods operate with low computational 
overhead to ensure timely responses to drift events.
 ● Memory Complexity Memory complexity measures the storage requirements of a method. Some algorithms require retaining large volumes of historical data or maintaining 
complex models of the feature space, which may not be feasible in resource-constrained 
settings.
5 Concept drift detection in image data: a comparison of current 
literature
In this section, we present 14 representative papers relevant to the task of concept drift 
detection. Among them, 11 originate from the traditional concept drift literature, while the 
remaining 3 are drawn from the computer vision domain, specifically addressing the problem of novel classes, one of the main causes of real concept drift. Although these papers 
operate under different assumptions and settings, we include them to illustrate promising 
research directions that can inform and inspire future work in concept drift detection for 
image data. We analyze these methods through the lens of our proposed taxonomy, highlighting their core characteristics and key distinctions. Each approach is first described in 
detail, followed by an evaluation of its effectiveness based on the criteria outlined in our 
framework.
5.1 Methods description
This section aims to present and characterize the key aspects of existing state-of-the-art 
approaches. Specifically, we summarize their core ideas and relevant features, and highlight their general properties, as organized in Table 5. Our analysis goes beyond the drift 
detection techniques themselves; we also examine how each method handles image feature 
representation, the specific causes of concept drift it addresses, and the datasets it employs. 
These dimensions are considered critical for effectively understanding and evaluating concept drift in image data.
5.1.1 High-dimensional multi-label data stream classification with concept drifting 
detection (MRMR)
Li et al. (2023) address the challenges of concept drift in high-dimensional multi-label data 
streams by using a feature selection-based framework. Their approach refines the minimalredundancy-maximal-relevance (MRMR) feature selection method based on mutual information, and detects concept drift by monitoring changes in both the label distributions and 
the selected feature distributions between adjacent data chunks. Concept drift is detected if 
significant divergences are observed in either the label or feature spaces, using Hamming 
loss and cosine distance as detection criteria.

The method targets multi-label datasets such as Corel16k010 (Li and Wang 2008) and 
NUS-WIDE (Chua et al. 2009). There is no mention of the use of feature extraction, so we 
assume they operate on raw image pixels. This approach is supervised due to the need for 
ground-truth labels and works on the distribution level.
5.1.2 Context-aware drift detection (CA-Drift)
CA-Drift (Cobb and V an Looveren 2022) proposes a novel approach for concept drift 
detection inspired by causal inference. The key method builds upon the traditional Max -
imum-Mean-Discrepancy-based (MMD-based) two-sample test (Gretton et al. 2012), but 
introduces a context variable to allow differences in distribution. This allows the drift detector to take into account contexts that are expected to change and focus only on changes 
that cannot be attributed to the context variable. These context variables could be various 
factors that can lead to a variation in the distribution of data such as time of day, weather 
conditions, or any other domain-specific context. The method works by comparing the conditional distributions of the data, which is done by calculating conditional MMDs (based on 
kernel mean embeddings) between reference and deployment data, extended by the context 
variable.
The paper mentions experiments on the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al. 2009) using Santurkar’s hierarchy classification (Santurkar et al. 2020) with 10 superclasses, each superclass containing 50 subclasses. They only used 25 subclasses as reference distribution for

the superclass and the other 25 subclasses acted as a drifted alternative. The drifted samples 
come from different subclasses (new subclasses), hence, will be detected as they don’t follow the same conditional distribution. This experiment utilized a pre-trained SimCLR (Chen 
et al. 2020) model for feature extraction, and its classification head for context.
5.1.3 Concept drift adaptation with scarce labels (CDASC)
CDASC (Y uan et al. 2024) proposes a mechanism to detect and adapt to concept drift in 
streaming data, leveraging diffusion learning when drift is detected and adversarial learning when no drift is observed. The approach integrates three key components: a feature 
extractor, a diffusion module, and two classifiers. The feature extractor is implemented as a 
two-layer fully connected neural network, while diffusion learning ensures that similar data 
points are mapped closer in the latent space, and dissimilar data points are further from each 
other. The method also addresses the challenge of scarce labels. It achieves this by mapping 
the features of unlabeled data into the latent space of labeled data, maximizing the discrepancy between the classifiers to identify data points near the decision boundary. These identified points are then used to adversarially update the feature extractor, effectively expanding 
the model’s representation of the data distribution. To detect drift, the system continuously 
monitors the distance between the feature vectors of incoming data and the learned cluster 
centers. If a significant change is detected in the distance, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test 
is employed to verify whether concept drift has occurred.
CDASC is evaluated successfully on the Permuted MNIST (Goodfellow et al. 2014) and 
Rotated MNIST (Lopez-Paz and Ranzato 2017) datasets, which simulates virtual drifts of 
the original MNIST (Deng 2012) dataset. The approach demonstrates a new solution to concept drift detection and adaptation under conditions of limited labeled data, aligning closely 
with the objectives of unsupervised drift detection. However, the simplicity of the feature 
extractor poses potential challenges, including misrepresentation of complex data and scalability issues when applied to larger or more intricate datasets.
5.1.4 Concept drift detection method via boundary shrinking (CDDBS)
CDDBS (Okawa and Kobayashi 2021) employs an ensemble of different inspector models, 
each of which is trained to intentionally shrink within specific classification regions of its 
class. This shrinking ensures that the inspector models react more sensitively to changes 
in data distribution within their designated classes, making them highly responsive to con -
cept drift. To train each inspector model, CDDBS removed data points that are mapped 
closely to the original model’s decision boundary, or in other words, with low confidence 
scores. When drift occurs, the inspector models, due to their reduced boundary areas, are 
more likely to detect misclassified instances that have shifted within the classification space. 
The method uses classification scores obtained from the inspector models and calculates 
the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence with historical scores. If the divergence exceeds a 
predefined threshold, it signals the occurrence of drift in a specific class. The use of KL 
divergence helps to quantify how much the classification scores have deviated from their 
non-drifted state, thus providing a robust detection mechanism.
The authors proved the effectiveness of their method in detecting concept drift in image 
data using the CIFAR-10 dataset (Krizhevsky and Hinton 2009). Drift was synthetically

simulated through various image manipulation techniques, such as blurring, darkening, 
rotation, etc. The method employs the MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al. 2018) architecture, a 
53-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for mobile devices.
5.1.5 Adaptive matrix sketching and clustering (AMSC)
AMSC (Zhang et al. 2018) employs matrix sketching to model large data as a low-dimen -
sional approximation matrix through singular value decomposition (SVD). Motivated by 
Mu et al. (2017), the method stores two kinds of matrix sketching: a global sketching G for 
the whole dataset and a local sketching Li for every known class. The matrix G is updated 
dynamically whenever new data arrives to help identify both known and new classes from 
streaming data. The new class detection is done by calculating the distance between new 
instances with the matrix itself and comparing the distance with an adaptive threshold. The 
method also integrates the Clustering by Fast Searching and finding density peaks (CFS) 
algorithm (Rodriguez and Laio 2014) to effectively group data points into new clusters, 
minimizing the need for labeled data.
The author tested this approach on the MNIST dataset (Deng 2012), and the drift is 
simulated by reducing the number of initially known classes. For feature extraction, a CNN 
with two convolution layers is used and the output of the first layer is chosen as extracted 
features.
5.1.6 Label-free concept drift detection method based on a defect segmentation 
model (DSM)
DSM (Li et al. 2024) is a concept drift detection method tailored for industrial images. 
Unlike many approaches that rely on features extracted from the penultimate (pre-prediction) layer of a neural network, DSM adopts a feature selection algorithm called Relief 
(Urbanowicz et al. 2018). Specifically, the proposed method uses a neural network segmentation model to generate intermediate features and augments them with additional indicators 
such as grayscale and texture. The Relief algorithm then processes these combined features 
to produce a final, characteristic feature set. These features act as image representations, 
which are subsequently clustered to determine a central vector for each class. Each class 
has its own threshold, defined by the maximum distance of its in-class data points from the 
central vector. To quantify how new data points deviate from these clusters, the Mahalanobis distance is computed between incoming samples and each class’s central vector; a data 
point is flagged as drift if it exceeds the class-specific threshold.
The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on the RSDDs-I and RSDDs-II datasets (Gan et al. 2017), both containing images of normal and heavy transport track surface 
defects. These datasets were selected because of their grayscale and texture characteristics, 
making the methodology particularly relevant.
5.1.7 Unsupervised concept drift detection from deep learning representations in 
real-time (DriftLens)
Greco et al. (2024) introduced DriftLens as an unsupervised real-time concept drift detection 
framework designed for unstructured data using deep-learning representations. DriftLens 
1 3

Q.-T. Tran et al.
operates by extracting embeddings from a deep learning model and applying dimensionality 
reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Maćkiewicz and Ratajczak 1993) in 
order to represent these embeddings as a multivariate normal distribution. The framework 
is composed of two phases: offline and online. In the offline phase, DriftLens constructs a 
baseline distribution of the deep learning embeddings derived from the initial training data. 
During the online phase, the framework processes new data in sliding windows and com -
pares the distribution of embeddings from the new window to the baseline distribution using 
the Fréchet Distance (Dowson and Landau 1982) (also known as Wasserstein-2 distance). 
When this distance exceeds a predefined threshold, concept drift is detected, indicating that 
the new data deviates significantly from the previously observed distribution.
DriftLens is evaluated on the STL-10 (Coates et al. 2011) and Intel Image (Rahimzadeh 
et al. 2021) datasets, where concept drifts are simulated by (1) introducing new classes and 
(2) applying blur to the images. The framework leverages ViTs (Dosovitskiy et al. 2021) and 
VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) models to generate image embeddings.
5.1.8 Concept drift and covariate shift detection ensemble with lagged labels 
(CDCSDE)
CDCSDE (Xu and Klabjan 2021) proposes an ensemble-based approach to concept drift 
detection, combining six statistical measures to capture both real concept drift (changes in 
the relationship between features and labels) and virtual drift (changes in the feature distribution alone). The six metrics employed are: Exponentially Weighted Moving Average of 
classification error rates, Model uncertainty measurement, Hellinger distance between distributions, Auto-encoder reconstruction error, Sum-product network likelihood, and Natural 
gradient changes. Each metric generates a time series, and the method monitors these series 
to detect drift. Drift detection is achieved through a majority voting strategy across these 
metrics, as each contributes differently to the identification of drift.
The method is evaluated on image data using the MNIST (Deng 2012) and USPS (Hull 
1994) datasets, both of which consist of handwritten digit images. Drift is simulated by 
training the model on MNIST and introducing USPS as the drift dataset due to differences in 
image quality and style. A 2-layer convolutional neural network is employed as the feature 
extractor.
5.1.9 Image-based drift detector (IBDD)
IBDD (Souza et al. 2020) is designed to address several key challenges in concept drift 
detection for streaming data, including limited label availability, real-time detection, and 
model dependence. The method operates by converting high-dimensional data from dif -
ferent time windows into two-dimensional visual representations, allowing for monitoring 
changes in data distribution over time. These visual representations are interpreted as grayscale images, where pixel intensity encodes the features of each image in the window. To 
measure similarity between the two images, IBDD employs the Mean Squared Deviation 
(MSD) metric. Drift detection is based on monitoring the time series of MSD values: if a 
sequence of values consistently exceeds or falls below a predefined threshold, concept drift 
is detected.

Concept drift detection in image data stream: a survey on current…
IBDD is evaluated on the Ham10000 dataset (Tschandl et al. 2018), a skin cancer dataset 
collected over 20 years. Drift is simulated by sorting the data ascending by the patient’s age, 
reflecting the higher risk of skin cancer with age. IBDD works directly on raw image pixels 
without the use of any feature extraction.
5.1.10 Image drift
Fuccellaro et al. (2024) introduce the Gaussian Split Detector (GSD) to address the challenge of detecting concept drift in image data streams without requiring access to groundtruth labels during inference. Image Drift operates by modeling the distributions of selected 
features using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) during training and estimating drifts in 
decision boundaries during inference. It computes optimal decision boundaries between 
classes based on Gaussian assumptions and flags drift when significant shifts in these 
boundaries are detected across an ensemble of simple splits. The method primarily detects 
real concept drift (changes that impact the decision boundary) and is explicitly designed to 
ignore virtual drift (distribution changes that do not affect classification).
The approach is evaluated on popular computer vision datasets, including MNIST (Deng 
2012), Fashion-MNIST (Xiao et al. 2017), CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky and 
Hinton 2009), where drift is simulated through image perturbations such as Gaussian noise 
and geometric shifts. The method works on raw image pixels without using any feature 
extraction.
5.1.11 A new approach for concept drift detection in visual data (Visual-Drift)
Visual-Drift (Tran et al. 2024) introduces a pipeline method for detecting concept drift 
in image data. The pipeline consists of three key components: a feature extractor using a 
pre-trained transformer model, dimensionality reduction, and a distance-based algorithm 
for drift detection. Visual-Drift mentions the importance of selecting an embedding model 
capable of capturing the semantic meaning of images, ensuring effective representation in 
latent space. Dimensionality reduction is applied to lower computational costs while uncovering the underlying structure of the data. For drift detection, Visual-Drift utilizes Median 
Absolute Deviation (MAD) (Leys et al. 2013) to model the distribution of each class. This 
statistical measure accounts for variations in class tightness and calculates an adaptive 
threshold for each class. A drift is detected when a new data point falls outside the threshold 
of all known classes, identifying it as an outlier.
The pipeline employs CLIP (Radford et al. 2021) as the feature extractor and UMAP 
(McInnes et al. 2020) for dimensionality reduction. The method is tested on the CIFAR-10 
and CIFAR-100 datasets (Krizhevsky and Hinton 2009), with drift simulated by introducing 
new classes from CIFAR-100 into the CIFAR-10 training set.
5.1.12 CSI: novelty detection via contrastive learning on distributionally shifted 
instances
CSI (Tack et al. 2020) addresses the challenge of novel classes for image data by propos -
ing a new approach that leverages contrastive learning. CSI extends standard contrastive 
learning by introducing distribution-shifting augmentations (e.g., rotations, Gaussian noise) 
1 3

## Page 26 / 42

Q.-T. Tran et al.
that simulate out-of-distribution samples. During training, CSI pushes these shifted aug -
mentations away from original samples (treating them as negatives), while pulling together 
regular augmentations (positives), encouraging the network to learn features that can better 
separate in-distribution from shifted/out-of-distribution samples. For detection, CSI defines 
a new scoring function combining representation similarity and auxiliary classification on 
shifted instances to identify novel inputs.
The method targets image datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky and 
Hinton 2009), and ImageNet (Deng et al. 2009), and is designed to handle scenarios where 
the novelty manifests as significant distributional shifts, similar to real concept drift through 
the introduction of new classes. CSI builds on contrastive representation learning (specifically SimCLR Chen et al. 2020) and uses a ResNet model as its backbone.
5.1.13 Open-world semi-supervised learning (ORCA)
ORCA (Cao et al. 2022) is introduced as a framework to address the open-world semisupervised learning problem, where novel classes can appear in the unlabeled data at test 
time. ORCA operates by combining three main components: a supervised objective with 
an uncertainty adaptive margin, a pairwise objective for generating pseudo-labels among 
unlabeled data, and a regularization term to prevent trivial clustering solutions. First, ORCA 
introduces the uncertainty adaptive margin into the entropy loss to slow down the overfitting 
of seen classes. Secondly, to discover novel classes, ORCA includes a pairwise similarity 
learning task to generate pseudo-labels for new samples by identifying their nearest neigh -
bors. These pseudo-labels are then used to group unlabeled data into clusters, which can 
discover novel classes. ORCA uses a set of classification heads, including extra heads that 
can be dynamically activated for novel class discovery based on clustering in the feature 
space. Finally, a regularization term using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to prevent the 
model from assigning all data into one class.
ORCA is evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky and Hinton 2009), ImageNet 
(Deng et al. 2009), and the Single-Cell Mouse Atlas dataset (Almanzar et al. 2020), targeting real concept drift where new classes emerge over time. The method uses deep feature 
extraction via a ResNet backbone pretrained with SimCLR (Chen et al. 2020) self-supervised learning. Features are continuously updated during ORCA’s training, with additional 
novel class heads dynamically activated for discovered classes.
5.1.14 Generalized category discover (GCD)
V aze et al. (2022) proposed the Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) framework to 
address a more realistic open-world learning scenario in which unlabeled data may con -
tain both known and novel classes. The method detects novel classes through a combina -
tion of contrastive representation learning and semi-supervised clustering. First, GCD uses 
ViTs (Dosovitskiy et al. 2021) pretrained with DINO (Caron et al. 2021) and fine-tunes it 
using supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses, producing embeddings that preserve 
semantic similarity. After fine-tuning, the embeddings are clustered using a semi-supervised 
K-means algorithm, where centroids for known classes are initialized using labeled data and 
additional centroids are initialized for potential novel classes using K-means++ on unla1 3

beled data. GCD runs k-means clustering with various values of k, and the optimal number 
of clusters is selected when labeled data clustering accuracy is maximized.
GCD is evaluated on both generic datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 Krizhevsky and 
Hinton 2009, ImageNet Deng et al. 2009) and fine-grained benchmarks (SSB benchmark 
V aze et al. 2022 and Herbarium19 Tan et al. 2019), focusing on real drift due to novel class 
emergence.
5.2 Methods analysis: evaluation metrics, quantitative results comparison, 
strengths and limitations
Based on the surveyed papers, we provide a comparison of concept drift detection methods, 
highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses, as summarized in Table 6. In addition, we present quantitative comparisons of different methods in Table 7. Approaches that 
specifically address the detection of novel classes are discussed separately and summarized 
in Table 8.
5.2.1 Evaluation metrics
Across the literature, evaluation is tailored to the drift setting. For novel-class emergence, 
studies typically report standard classification metrics like Precision, Recall, F1, AUROC, 
and Accuracy, treating the appearance of a new class as a detection problem. For other drift 
types in streaming scenarios, many approaches augment Recall/F1/AUROC/Accuracy with 
event-aware and time-aware criteria. False alarms are often quantified in number or tracked 
as mean time between false alarms (MTFA), capturing stability against drift triggers. Detection Delay is another measurement, often referred to as the difference between when drift 
is detected and occurs. Other works also report Runtime/Latency and sometimes the num -
ber of Hidden Nodes (HN) in a neural network to establish feasibility under real-time or 
resource-constrained deployments.
Despite these common choices, evaluation in image-based, real-time streaming settings 
remains fragmented. First, metric definitions are inconsistent. For instance, “False alarms” 
may be reported as a raw count, a rate or mean time between false alarms (MTFA). Second, 
evaluation protocols vary widely. Crucial details like label latency, how many labels are 
available, and when the model is updated (immediately after an alarm or on a schedule) 
are often unstated, yet they directly influence the metrics results. Reporting is also uneven: 
many papers show only a single run without a fixed random seed, omit confidence intervals 
across streams or events, and tune thresholds with information from the test stream (i.e., 
leakage). Together, these practices undermine fair comparison. Third, there is no shared 
concept drift benchmark suite for image data streams. Many studies convert static datasets 
into streams with drift injection (brightness/blur/jitter, domain swaps, class imbalance), but 
the severities, durations (abrupt vs. gradual), and frequencies are not standardized. This 
makes evaluations difficult and often under-represents realistic shifts such as sensor aging, 
seasonal illumination, or camera pose drift.

5.2.2 Quantitative comparison comparison
Tables 7 and 8 summarize reported results of concept drift detection methods on virtual and 
real concept drift, as well as on novel class detection. It is important to note that the results 
are drawn from different metrics and experimental protocols as reported in the original 
papers. Consequently, the tables should be read as indicative comparisons rather than as 
outcomes of a uniform benchmark. Nevertheless, several insights can be highlighted.

Q.-T. Tran et al.
For methods summarized in Table 7, supervised MRMR achieves high robustness with 
relatively low false alarms and detection misses, though at the cost of requiring groundtruth labels. Among unsupervised methods, CDDBS reports competitive detection rates 
but suffers from accuracy degradation and scalability issues with large class sets. DSM 
demonstrates excellent performance in domain-specific industrial streams, with near-perfect 
AUC under both gradual and abrupt drift, though its applicability beyond industrial settings 
remains unclear. Methods that operate directly on raw data, such as IBDD and Image Drift, 
achieve fast runtimes. However, their reliance on pixel-level comparisons limits their ability 
to capture semantic changes, as shown by poor performance on more complex datasets such 
as CIFAR. On the other hand, DriftLens, which leverages pretrained features, consistently 
improves F1 scores, illustrating the benefit of combining deep representation learning with 
drift detection. Ensemble approaches such as CDCSDE show robustness across abrupt and 
gradual drifts, but their reliance on multiple metrics incurs significant computational cost. 
Taken together, these results suggest a trade-off between speed versus semantic sensitivity, 
with representation learning approaches offering better generalization across diverse settings, while raw pixel methods excel in scenarios requiring real-time efficiency.
In the context of novel class detection (Table 8), the setup typically involves splitting 
datasets into seen (known) classes and novel (previously unseen) classes. In cases where the 
same dataset is used for both, classes are partitioned into known and novel subsets; when 
different datasets are used, one serves as the known domain and the other introduces new 
classes. Even if the setup is similar, splitting rates and protocols vary across papers, and the 
table reports results as provided by the original authors.
Several trends emerge. Visual Drift and CSI achieve strong results by leveraging pretrained representations GCD, which combines self-supervised ViTs with clustering, also 
generalizes well across datasets, though its accuracy drops on more fine-grained datasets 
(e.g., CIFAR100, ImageNet). ORCA provides robust accuracy on CIFAR10 but performance deteriorates on more complex datasets such as CIFAR100, revealing sensitivity to 
dataset complexity and training protocol. DriftLens and AMSC, although not specifically 
designed for novel classes, report strong F1 scores on STL-10 and MNIST, respectively, 
showing that representation-focused approaches can extend to novelty detection. Overall, 
novelty detection methods clearly benefit from representation learning and clustering strateMethod Setting Dataset Results

gies, which enable separation of known and novel categories. However, their performance 
varies significantly across datasets, suggesting that scalability and adaptability remain open 
challenges.
In summary, while virtual and real drift detection methods differ widely in their evaluation settings, a clear distinction can be made: methods relying on representation learning 
offer improved accuracy and robustness, while raw image-based approaches prioritize efficiency. In contrast, novelty detection methods form a distinct family that primarily focuses 
on robust representation learning, but their generalization across datasets remains an active 
challenge.

5.2.3 Strengths and limitations
Among the surveyed methods, MRMR is the only one that fully relies on ground-truth 
labels, making it a supervised approach. While its reliance on labels makes the method less 
practical in real-world scenarios where annotation is costly and time-consuming, MRMR 
demonstrates that combining label distributions with image feature distributions can significantly improve both speed and robustness, especially in multi-label data streams. This illustrates a broader trade-off in drift detection: accuracy and robustness gained from supervision 
versus scalability and practicality in unlabeled settings.
In contrast, most existing approaches are unsupervised, yet they differ in how they 
represent image data and in the type of drifts they target. For example, CA-Drift, AMSC, 
and CDDBS extend classical statistical or sketching-based strategies. While these methods introduce novel ideas—such as contextual variables in CA-Drift or matrix sketching 
in AMSC—they remain largely agnostic to the semantic content of images, which limits 
their ability to capture subtle image-driven changes. Moreover, computational scalability 
remains a bottleneck, particularly for CDDBS when applied to high-class regimes. In comparison, CDASC and DSM begin to address image-specific challenges by integrating diffusion learning and domain-tailored modeling (industrial image streams, in the case of DSM). 
These methods highlight a growing shift in the field toward improved feature representations as the foundation for effective drift detection.
Another family of works attempts to bypass feature extraction altogether by operat -
ing directly on raw image data. Notable examples include IBDD and Image Drift. These 
approaches are extremely fast, making them suitable for real-time deployment. However, 
their reliance on pixel-level comparisons limits their ability to capture semantic changes in 
image content. Furthermore, Image Drift assumes Gaussianity in the data distribution, an 
assumption that rarely holds in practice. This reflects a recurring trade-off: methods optimized for speed often sacrifice semantic awareness, restricting their applicability to more 
complex domains.
A more recent trend leverages pretrained deep models as feature extractors. DriftLens 
and Visual Drift follow this paradigm by combining deep feature extraction with dimension reduction. This hybrid strategy improves both accuracy and computational efficiency, 
demonstrating strong potential for general-purpose use. However, neither method supports 
domain adaptation or addressing core image problems, limiting their applicability in crossdomain or transfer scenarios—an increasingly important challenge in real-world settings.
Recently, a distinct family of methods has emerged that focuses on novelty detection, 
i.e., the identification of previously unseen classes. In contrast to approaches that monitor 
distributional shifts within a fixed label set, novelty detection methods explicitly address 
structural changes in the label space. As this has become a highly active research direction, 
it is essential to distinguish these approaches from traditional drift detection. Most methods 
in this category emphasize representation learning using self-supervised methods, aiming 
to build feature spaces that can separate known classes while remaining flexible enough to 
accommodate novel ones.
Representative examples include CSI, which leverages contrastive learning to build 
robust feature spaces and detect both calibration shifts and novel classes. ORCA jointly 
learns to classify known categories while discovering new ones via multiple classification 
heads and pairwise similarity objectives, making it powerful in offline discovery scenarios

Concept drift detection in image data stream: a survey on current…
but less suitable for streaming due to its reliance on full access to unlabeled data. GCD 
advances this direction by combining self-supervised Vision Transformers (DINO) (Caron 
et al. 2021) with semi-supervised clustering, enabling strong cross-domain generalization 
but lacking online adaptability.
Taken together, these methods demonstrate that the emphasis on self-supervised learning 
and clustering help with detecting novel classes, one of the causes of concept drift. Over -
all, self-supervised pretraining provides stronger, more generalizable representations that 
reduce sensitivity to small and moderate drifts, especially in virtual drifts and unseen-butsimilar domains. However, for severe concept drift or novel class emergence, representation 
learning alone is insufficient—continual adaptation or novelty detection mechanisms are 
still necessary.
6 Challenges and future research direction
This survey has presented a comprehensive overview of concept drift detection approaches 
for image data, beginning with a broad discussion of the concept drift domain and narrow -
ing down to a critical analysis of existing detection methods specifically for image data. 
We examined key criteria that define an effective drift detection method, highlighting their 
strengths, limitations, and applicability. Additionally, we explored essential aspects such 
as datasets and evaluation metrics, which play a crucial role in assessing detection perfor -
mance. Based on our analysis, we identify several key challenges in image-based concept 
drift detection along with promising future research directions. A detailed discussion of 
these challenges is provided below, while Table 9 summarizes the current progress and 
remaining open issues in a concise overview.

Q.-T. Tran et al.
6.1 Generalization
One of the central challenges in concept drift detection for image data is achieving generalization across diverse domains and drift scenarios.
Across Different Domains Many existing methods are designed with assumptions tied to 
specific datasets or visual domains. This limits their ability to generalize to new application 
areas such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or industrial inspection. Methods tailored 
to natural images often underperform when transferred to domains with different statistical 
properties, such as satellite imagery with multi-spectral bands.
Across different causes of drift Most image-based concept drift detection methods are tailored to a specific cause of drift, either virtual drift (Y uan et al. 2024; Okawa and Kobayashi 
2021; Li et al. 2024; Souza et al. 2020) or real concept drift (Cobb and V an Looveren 2022; 
Zhang et al. 2018; Tran et al. 2024). Moreover, within real drift, the majority target only the 
emergence of novel classes while largely neglecting in-class evolution—a more subtle and 
underexplored form of drift. Future work should aim to develop methods capable of identifying and adapting to multiple types of drift simultaneously.
6.2 Feature learning for image data
Effective feature learning is essential for improving drift detection performance, yet remains 
underdeveloped in many existing methods for image data. Detecting concept drift in images 
requires not only monitoring changes in distributions but also understanding semantic shifts 
that occur over time—something that heavily depends on the quality of the learned feature 
representations.
Most concept drift detection methods applied to image data rely on simplistic feature 
extraction techniques, often using shallow CNN architectures (e.g., two-layer CNNs) 
(Zhang et al. 2018; Y uan et al. 2024; Xu and Klabjan 2021). While these approaches provide a basic representation of images, they may not be sufficient for capturing the complex, 
hierarchical features needed to distinguish subtle distribution shifts.
Recent advances from the computer vision community—such as CSI (Tack et al. 2020), 
ORCA (Cao et al. 2022), and GCD (V aze et al. 2022)—demonstrate the effectiveness of 
contrastive learning for producing robust and semantically meaningful embeddings. These 
methods employ self-supervised techniques (e.g., SimCLR (Chen et al. 2020), DINO (Caron 
et al. 2021)) or pairwise similarity learning to structure the feature space, enabling better 
discrimination between seen and novel classes. However, these methods often assume full 
access to unlabeled data, operating in a transductive or batch-mode setting. This is funda -
mentally different from streaming or online environments, where concept drift often occurs 
and where data arrives sequentially. A further research direction should involve adapting 
contrastive and self-supervised representation learning to streaming settings.
6.3 Computational efficiency
Scalability and real-time performance remain significant challenges in image-based concept 
drift detection. The inherently high dimensionality and unstructured nature of image data 
lead to increased computational and memory demands, particularly when processing largescale or high-frequency data streams.

Concept drift detection in image data stream: a survey on current…
While some recent methods have explored computationally efficient alternatives that 
operate directly on raw image pixels to avoid expensive feature extraction (Fuccellaro et al. 
2024; Souza et al. 2020), these approaches often involve a trade-off between speed and 
detection accuracy. Such methods may sacrifice semantic richness from feature extraction, 
which is critical for identifying subtle or high-level distributional changes in complex image 
streams.
To address these limitations, future research should prioritize the following directions:
 ● Lightweight feature extraction and dimensionality reduction Investigating methods such 
as adaptive PCA, sparsity-inducing neural architectures, or compressed representations 
that can reduce computation while preserving key semantic information.
 ● Modular and incrementally updatable frameworks Designing flexible architectures that 
support partial model updates, on-the-fly adaptation, or streamlined retraining, thereby 
avoiding the need to recompute the entire pipeline after each drift detection or adapta -
tion step.
6.4 Evaluation metrics and benchmarking
Evaluation Metrics The evaluation of concept drift detection methods for image data cur -
rently suffers from a lack of standardization, making fair comparison and reproducibility 
across studies difficult. Different works employ different metrics depending on their specific assumptions and settings, often without justification or consistency. While common 
drift-specific metrics such as Detection Delay, False Alarms, and Missed Detection Rate 
are used, they are frequently reported inconsistently or omitted altogether. For unsuper -
vised methods, performance is often assessed indirectly through proxy evaluations, such 
as downstream classification accuracy or clustering purity, which may not fully reflect drift 
detection capabilities.
Benchmarking There is a lack of shared benchmark datasets that represent a variety of 
drift types and define a problem setting. Most current studies simulate drift via manipulations like noise, occlusions, or new class introduction, often inconsistently. A potential new 
benchmark should include a range of predefined drift scenarios (e.g., virtual drift, novel 
class emergence, in-class evolution) and clearly annotated ground-truth change points, similar to the design of the Semantic Shift Benchmark (V aze et al. 2022).
To advance the field, it is crucial for the community to establish standardized evaluation 
protocols and, equally importantly, to develop shared benchmarks based on annotated, realworld image streams. Such benchmarks would enable systematic comparison across meth -
ods and ensure that evaluation settings reflect the practical challenges of deploying concept 
drift detection in real-world applications.

Appendix A: Datasets
A range of existing image datasets has been applied in concept drift detection research, 
though many were not originally designed for this purpose. Datasets like ImageNet (Deng 
et al. 2009), CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky and Hinton 2009), STL-10 (Coates et al. 2011), MNIST 
(Deng 2012), and USPS (Hull 1994) are widely used due to their extensive image collec -
tions, allowing researchers to simulate temporal changes and class evolution. These datasets 
typically consist of diverse categories, making them suitable for testing class distribution 
shifts in incremental learning contexts. More domain-specific datasets are also used, such as 
Ham10000 (Tschandl et al. 2018), which includes skin lesion images for medical applica -
tions, or RSDDs (Gan et al. 2017), focusing on surface defect detection in industrial set -
tings, or Intel Image (Rahimzadeh et al. 2021), including images of natural scenes around 
the world. Table 10 provides a comprehensive summary of all datasets employed in the 
surveyed studies discussed in Sect. 4.
In concept drift research, synthetic datasets have played a crucial role due to their con -
trolled environments, allowing researchers to systematically simulate different types of 
drift, such as gradual, sudden, or recurring. Synthetic drift scenarios enable precise manip -
ulations, such as introducing new classes over time or applying various image manipu -
lation techniques to mimic environmental changes. Common manipulations (Okawa and 
Kobayashi 2021) include (a) GaussianBlur (Blur) to simulate degradation in image clarity, 
(b) Darken to mimic lighting changes, (c) Rotate to replicate shifts in object orientation, (d)

Concept drift detection in image data stream: a survey on current…
GaussianNoise (Noisy) to introduce random interference, (e) Rain to add weather effects, 
and (f) Snow for seasonal variations. These alterations help create controlled drift scenarios, 
which can be arranged in various ways to simulate gradual changes, abrupt shifts, or recurring drift events. An example of this approach is the Rotated MNIST (R.MNIST) (LopezPaz and Ranzato 2017) and Permuted MNIST (P .MNIST) (Goodfellow et al. 2014) datasets, 
which apply specific transformations to the original MNIST dataset to simulate drift. In 
R.MNIST, digits are incrementally rotated, creating a continuous drift as the angle of rota -
tion changes. In P.MNIST, pixels are permuted randomly, simulating a drift that introduces 
new patterns over time.
Real-world datasets, while more complex and less predictable, offer a more authentic 
representation of drift as it naturally occurs. However, given that concept drift detection in 
image data is still an emerging field, most current research relies on synthetic datasets. Realworld datasets for drift detection are rare, particularly in image-based applications, and lack 
the explicit drift labeling or temporal annotations often needed for detailed analysis.
Overall, currently available datasets in image data for concept drift detection face several 
challenges. First, there is a lack of diversity in drift types across available datasets; most 
datasets primarily support simulated or incremental changes, with few options that capture 
complex or overlapping drift patterns seen in real-world settings. Secondly, acquiring largescale datasets that cover long-term temporal changes is challenging, making it difficult to 
assess how well drift detection methods perform over extended periods. Addressing these 
limitations is critical to advancing the field, as a more diverse set of datasets would allow 
for more robust benchmarking and evaluation.
